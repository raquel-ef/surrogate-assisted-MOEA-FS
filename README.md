# Surrogate-assisted and Filter-based Multiobjective Evolutionary Feature Selection for Deep Learning

## Overview
Feature selection (FS) for deep learning prediction models is a complex challenge. Traditional FS methods include:
- **Embedded methods**: Modify neural network weights to adjust attribute importance.
- **Filter methods**: Independent of learning algorithms but can limit prediction accuracy.
- **Wrapper methods**: Computationally expensive for deep learning.

This project proposes novel FS methods incorporating:
- **Multiobjective and many-objective evolutionary algorithms** for search strategies.
- **Surrogate-assisted approach** to reduce wrapper-type computational cost.
- **Filter-type objective functions** based on correlation and an adaptation of the reliefF algorithm.

The techniques were applied to air quality forecasting in Spain and indoor temperature prediction in a domotic house, yielding promising results.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and install the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
1. **Prepare the dataset**. Place data in `.arff` format in the `data/` directory. Note that the data must be previously transformed using a sliding window method (see function `lags` in `utils.py` for this transformation).
2. **Train the surrogate model**. Train the surrogate model using `build_LSTM.py` file. The parameters should be previously configured in `config.py`.
3. **Search the best problem**. Run the notebook `Problem search.ipynb` to find the best problem (objectives combination).
4. **Search the best algorithm**. Once the best problem is selected run the notebook `Algorithm search.ipynb` to find the best algorithm. Note that by default the problem will be `FS_O1O2O3_LSTM.py`
5. **Compare with other feature selection methods**. Run the notebook `Comparisons FS methods.ipynb` to compare with other FS methods:

    - Wrapper multi-objective evolutionary FS method based on Linear Regression
    - Wrapper multi-objective evolutionary FS method based on Random Forest
    - Hybrid filter-wrapper FS method based on correlation and LSTM with deterministic search
    - Hybrid filter-wrapper FS method based on reliefF and LSTM with deterministic search
